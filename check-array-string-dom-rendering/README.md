**use some server to run these examples:**
```
$ python -m http.server 8000   # sometimes it is easier way to run something :)

$ npm install -g http-server   # install dependency via npm package 
$ http-server -p 8000

$ npm install -g node-static   # install dependency via npm package 
$ static -p 8000
```
